# Feature Specification: Lurker Kicking Bot

**Feature Branch**: `[001-lurker-kicking-bot]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "lurker-kicking-bot"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the channel owner/mod, I want a bot to audit Telegram/Discord groups for
inactive lurkers, challenge them via DM to confirm they‚Äôre active, and remove
those who do not respond within a grace period, so the community stays engaged.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a group with 1000 members and inactivity threshold of
   [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: days, e.g., 30], when an admin runs the audit command,
   then the bot DMs identified lurkers with a challenge and records a
   ChallengeSession for each.
2. Given a challenged user does not respond within
   [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: grace window, e.g., 48h] after two prompts,
   when the window expires, then the bot removes the user unless on the
   allowlist and logs a ModerationAction.
3. Given a new show is scheduled for
   [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: lead time, e.g., 30‚Äì60 min], when the time window
   opens, then the bot posts a templated announcement to configured channels
   and records the Announcement.
4. Given the admin searches archived messages for a keyword,
   when the admin runs a search command, then the bot returns top matches with
   links and metadata, respecting access permissions.
5. Given a username is queried, when the admin requests a profile lookup,
   then the bot returns basic activity stats and disruptor signals for review
   without auto-banning.

### Edge Cases
- Quiet hours: no removals between [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: local hours].
- Users with closed DMs: challenge via mention or skip with log.
- Platform limits: respect Telegram/Discord rate limits with backoff.
- Protections: admins/mods/allowlisted users are never removed.
- Failure handling: network/API errors retried with jitter; actions idempotent.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: MUST identify lurkers using an inactivity threshold of
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: N days] and recent activity heuristics per platform.
- **FR-002**: MUST challenge identified lurkers via DM with up to
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: attempts, e.g., 2] prompts within
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: window, e.g., 48h].
- **FR-003**: MUST remove users who fail the challenge unless on allowlist and
  MUST log a ModerationAction with reason and timestamps.
- **FR-004**: MUST post show announcements with a configurable template and
  lead time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION], to selected channels.
- **FR-005**: MUST archive group messages with metadata to enable search by
  keyword, user, channel, and date range, subject to privacy rules.
- **FR-006**: MUST provide an admin-only search and user lookup interface via
  bot commands.
- **FR-007**: MUST respect quiet hours for destructive actions and provide a
  dry-run mode for bulk operations.
- **FR-008**: MUST maintain audit logs of actions (challenge, remove, announce)
  and provide export on request.
- **FR-009**: MUST support both Telegram and Discord groups/servers configured
  via admin commands or config.
- **FR-010**: MUST protect admins/mods/allowlisted users from automated actions.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST retain archived messages for
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period, e.g., 180/365 days].
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce access controls for archive search
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: owner-only, selected moderators].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Member**: Platform user with roles, last activity timestamp, allowlist flag.
- **ChallengeSession**: DM prompts, attempts, status, deadlines, outcomes.
- **Announcement**: Title, link, schedule, target channels, message template.
- **MessageArchive**: Message id, author, channel, content digest, timestamps.
- **ModerationAction**: Type (challenge/remove/warn), reason, actor, references.
