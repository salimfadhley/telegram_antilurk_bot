## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Background

This bot supports moderation for a large Telegram community associated with a
popular YouTube channel. Its core goal is to identify and ultimately reduce the
number of non‚Äëparticipating members ("lurkers") to maintain an engaged
community. A member is considered a lurker when they have not responded within
the configured "lurk threshold" ‚Äî 14 days by default (configurable). The
system tracks the last time a member responded and uses public challenges in the
moderated chat to gauge engagement before any manual moderation action by admins.
For v1, the bot does not remove users automatically; it informs admins via a
modlog channel or, if unlinked, retains internal reports accessible from the
moderated channel.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the Telegram group owner/mod, I want a bot to audit the group for inactive
lurkers, challenge them in the moderated chat with a simple multiple‚Äëchoice
puzzle (arithmetic or common‚Äësense) to confirm they are human/active, and
publish outcome reports to a linked modlog channel (no auto‚Äëremoval), so the
community stays engaged and admins stay informed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a group with 1000 members and an inactivity threshold of 14 days
   (default, configurable), when an admin runs the audit command, then the
   bot posts a public challenge in the moderated chat with a simple
   multiple‚Äëchoice puzzle (mentioning the user) and
   records a ChallengeSession for each.
2. Given a challenged user does not respond within the provocation interval
   (default 48h, configurable), when the interval expires, then the bot posts
   a notification to the configured modlog channel stating the user did not
   respond and schedules the next prompt cycle (no maximum), incrementing the
   per-user prompt count.
   If the user responds at any time by pressing an answer button in the
   moderated chat, then the bot
   resets their last‚Äëinteraction timestamp. If the answer is correct, the bot
   thanks them; if the answer is incorrect, the bot thanks them and posts to
   the modlog channel that they failed the challenge with an inline Kick
   button.
3. Given a user selects an incorrect answer, when the bot processes the
   response, then it logs the failure, thanks the user with a light nudge
   (e.g., ‚Äúare you sure about that?‚Äù), and posts to the modlog channel with a
   Kick button for admins to act.
4. Given a channel is configured in moderated mode and linked to a modlog
   channel, when messages are posted in the moderated channel, then the bot
   archives message metadata/content digests for search and analytics and
   publishes audit summaries and outcomes to the modlog channel.
5. Given a user is an admin in either the moderated channel or the modlog
   channel, when they issue an admin command to the bot, then the command is
   accepted and executed; if a non‚Äëadmin issues a command, the bot rejects it
   and optionally informs them they lack permission.
6. Given the bot is invited to a new Telegram chat, when it joins, then it
   posts a welcome message with inline buttons to select a mode (`moderated` or
   `modlog`) and also mentions the root command `/antlurk mode <moderated|modlog>`;
   if no selection is made, it defaults to `moderated`.
7. Given an admin sets a chat to `moderated` mode and no modlog link exists,
   when the admin runs `/antlurk mode moderated`, then the bot generates and
   posts a linking message in that chat (containing a unique code) instructing
   admins to forward it to their modlog channel to establish the link. This is
   the message that must be forwarded for linking.
8. Given that linking message is forwarded to a modlog channel where the bot is
   present, when the bot detects a valid, unexpired code, then it links the
   source moderated chat to the destination modlog channel and confirms in
   both places, and deletes the original linking message. If the code is
   invalid or expired (10‚Äëminute TTL), the bot deletes the stale message and
   asks to retry by issuing a new link message.
9. Given multiple moderated channels are linked to one modlog channel,
   when reports are emitted, then the modlog messages indicate the source
   channel name/ID to disambiguate.
10. Given no modlog channel has been linked for a moderated channel, when
    the bot generates reports or outcomes, then it records them internally and
    makes them available via admin queries issued in the moderated channel
    only, until a modlog is linked.
11. Given an admin attempts to view reports outside a moderated channel (e.g.,
    in a modlog channel), when they run `/antlurk show reports`, then
    the bot rejects the request and states that reports are only displayed in
    moderated channels.
12. Given an admin runs `/antlurk mode` without arguments in either a moderated
    or modlog chat, when the bot receives the command, then it displays the
    same inline mode selection buttons so the admin can quickly switch modes; if
    the admin runs `/antlurk mode moderated` or `/antlurk mode modlog`, the bot
    switches immediately without showing the button.
12. Given an admin wants activity insights, when they run
    `/antlurk report active [--days 7|30|N] [--limit M]` in a moderated
    channel, then the bot returns the most active users within the time window,
    ordered by message count.
13. Given an admin wants to identify low activity, when they run
    `/antlurk report inactive [--days N] [--limit M]` in a moderated channel,
    then the bot returns users with the fewest messages in the window (excluding
    non‚Äëmembers, bots, and allowlisted roles).
14. Given an admin wants to list lurkers, when they run
    `/antlurk report lurkers [--threshold-days D] [--limit M]` in a moderated
    channel, then the bot returns users whose last response exceeds the lurk
    threshold (default 14 days), including last activity timestamps.
3. Given a new show is scheduled for
   [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: lead time, e.g., 30‚Äì60 min], when the time window
   opens, then the bot posts a templated announcement to configured channels
   and records the Announcement.
4. Given the admin searches archived messages for a keyword,
   when the admin runs a search command, then the bot returns top matches with
   links and metadata, respecting access permissions.
5. Given a username is queried, when the admin requests a profile lookup,
   then the bot returns basic activity stats and disruptor signals for review
   without auto-banning.

### Edge Cases
 - Platform limits: respect Telegram rate limits with backoff.
- Protections: admins/mods/allowlisted users are never removed.
- Failure handling: network/API errors retried with jitter; actions idempotent.
- Reactions or read receipts alone do not count as responses.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: MUST identify lurkers using an inactivity threshold of 14 days
  by default (configurable) and recent activity heuristics for Telegram.
 - **FR-002**: MUST challenge identified lurkers in the moderated chat with a
   simple multiple‚Äëchoice puzzle (e.g., basic arithmetic or common‚Äësense
   questions such as ‚ÄúWhat colour is a fresh banana?‚Äù). MUST
   wait a provocation interval (default 48h, configurable) before re‚Äëprompting.
   There is no maximum prompt cycle; MUST track and expose per‚Äëuser prompt
   counts.
- **FR-003**: MUST NOT auto‚Äëremove users. On user response or timeout, MUST
  notify a configured modlog channel. If the user selects the wrong answer or
  does not respond within the provocation interval, the notification MUST
  include an inline Kick button for admins. MUST log a ModerationAction with
  timestamps.
- **FR-004**: MUST post show announcements with a configurable template and
  lead time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION], to selected channels.
- **FR-005**: MUST archive group messages with metadata to enable search by
  keyword, user, channel, and date range, subject to privacy rules.
- **FR-006**: MUST provide an admin-only search and user lookup interface via
  bot commands.
- **FR-007**: MUST support sending prompts and notifications at any time (no
  quiet hours) and provide a dry‚Äërun mode for bulk operations.
- **FR-008**: MUST maintain audit logs of actions (challenge, acknowledge,
  notify, announce) and provide export on request.
 - **FR-009**: MUST support Telegram groups/venues in v1 (Discord is
   out‚Äëof‚Äëscope for this version).
- **FR-010**: MUST protect admins/mods/allowlisted users from automated
  prompts and negative flags.
 - **FR-016**: MUST support two channel operating modes per Telegram chat:
   `moderated` mode (the bot moderates and archives this channel) and `modlog`
   mode (the bot publishes reports and actions for admins).
 - **FR-017**: MUST allow linking one or more moderated channels to a modlog
   channel (many‚Äëto‚Äëone). If no modlog channel is configured, MUST still log
   internally and allow admins to query status via commands.
 - **FR-018**: MUST restrict admin commands to Telegram users who are admins in
   either the linked moderated channel(s) or the modlog channel. Non‚Äëadmins
   MUST be denied.
 - **FR-019**: MUST archive messages (metadata + content digests) in
   `moderated` mode channels to support search and activity heuristics.
 - **FR-020**: On being added to a chat, MUST prompt admins to choose a mode
   using inline buttons (`moderated` or `modlog`), and default to `moderated` if
   not set; MUST use a single root command `/antlurk` with subcommands,
   including `/antlurk mode <moderated|modlog>`. Running `/antlurk mode` with no
   arguments MUST display the inline mode selection buttons.
 - **FR-021**: MUST support link establishment via forward‚Äëcode handshake:
   when a moderated channel lacks a modlog link, the bot posts a message with
   instructions and a unique code; forwarding that exact message to a modlog
   channel where the bot is present completes the link. Codes MUST expire after
   10 minutes and be single‚Äëuse; bot MUST verify the forward and the caller's
   admin rights and MUST delete the link message upon use or expiry.
 - **FR-022**: MUST support introspection and admin utilities via the root
   command namespace, e.g., `/antlurk show links`, `/antlurk show config`,
   `/antlurk show reports [limit]`, `/antlurk unlink <chat>`. Commands MUST
   respect admin checks. `show reports` MUST only display in moderated
   channels; running it elsewhere results in a polite refusal. When no modlog
   is linked, `show reports` provides recent internal logs to admins in the
   moderated channel.
  - **FR-026**: MUST provide reporting subcommands under `/antlurk report` that
    only execute in moderated channels: `active`, `inactive`, `lurkers`, each
    with optional `--days` and `--limit` parameters and sensible defaults
    (default window 30 days; default limit 20).
  - **FR-027**: MUST compute activity based on message counts within the window
    and identify lurkers based on last valid response timestamp compared to the
    configured lurk threshold (default 14 days, channel‚Äëoverridable).
  - **FR-028**: MUST exclude admins/mods/allowlisted/bots from punitive lists
    (e.g., `inactive`, `lurkers`) while still allowing their activity to appear
    in `active` reports if desired [configurable].
  - **FR-029**: MUST return report results with usernames, user IDs, counts,
    and last activity timestamps; MUST support simple pagination via `--offset`
    or by emitting a ‚Äúshow more‚Äù control if supported.
  - **FR-030**: SHOULD ensure queries are efficient on PostgreSQL using
    appropriate indexes on message timestamp, chat ID, user ID, and message
    type; large channels should return reports within a reasonable time budget.
  - **FR-031**: MUST reset a member‚Äôs last‚Äëinteraction timestamp on any message
    they post in the moderated channel and on any challenge answer button press
    (correct or incorrect).
  - **FR-032**: The Kick button posted to the modlog channel MUST only execute
    for admins; on press, the bot attempts to remove the user from the moderated
    channel and logs success/failure in the modlog channel and audit logs.
  - **FR-033**: Passing a challenge (correct answer) MUST NOT generate a modlog
    post; the outcome MUST still be recorded in audit logs and reflected in
    the member‚Äôs status.
  - **FR-035**: MUST read the Telegram bot token from `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` at
    startup; fail fast with a clear error if missing.
  - **FR-036**: MUST read PostgreSQL connection configuration from
    `DATABASE_URL`; validate connectivity on startup and fail fast with a clear
    error if unreachable or misconfigured.
  - **FR-037**: MUST persist runtime state needed to resume safely after
    container restarts (e.g., pending challenge sessions, next prompt times)
    using PostgreSQL as the source of truth; YAML is only for static config. On
    startup, resume schedules idempotently.
  - **FR-038**: SHOULD expose a simple readiness/health indicator (e.g., logs a
    ‚Äúready‚Äù message after successful initialization) and provide clear log lines
    for major lifecycle events (startup, linking, audits, reports).
 - **FR-023**: MUST persist the channel linking graph (moderated‚Üímodlog) and
   per‚Äëchat configuration at `$DATA_DIR/config/channels.yaml` and load/apply it
   on startup. Config files MUST be human‚Äëreadable YAML under `$DATA_DIR/config/`.
  - **FR-024**: MUST operate with `$DATA_DIR` defaulting to `/data` in
    containerized deployments, overridable via environment variable.
 - **FR-025**: MUST log all stored messages to a PostgreSQL database, recording
   at minimum: message ID, time, channel, and username; and SHOULD capture other
   readily available Telegram metadata (e.g., chat ID, user ID, message type,
   reply_to message ID, edit timestamp, forward/origin info). Coverage includes
   moderated channel messages and challenge interactions used for activity
   tracking and assessments. [Note: retention duration defined in FR‚Äë011.]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST retain archived messages for
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period, e.g., 180/365 days].
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce access controls for archive search
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: owner-only, selected moderators].
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate simple multiple‚Äëchoice puzzles: either
  arithmetic (addition/subtraction/multiplication within small integers) or
  common‚Äësense questions with obvious correct answers. Each puzzle MUST have
  3‚Äì4 choices, be randomly ordered, and track the correct answer per session.
  Examples: ‚ÄúWhat colour is a fresh banana? Red, Purple, Yellow‚Äù; ‚ÄúWhich has a
  high summit? Mountain, Toy train, Killer whale‚Äù.
- **FR-014**: System MUST treat any answer button press as user interaction and
  reset the user‚Äôs last‚Äëinteraction timestamp to ‚Äúnow‚Äù. If the answer is
  correct, respond with a short thank‚Äëyou message.
- **FR-015**: If the answer is incorrect, respond with a polite nudge (e.g.,
  ‚ÄúThanks for your response‚Ä¶ are you sure about that?‚Äù) and post a notice in
  the modlog channel with a Kick button for admins to take action.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Member**: Platform user with roles, last activity timestamp, allowlist flag.
- **ChallengeSession**: Puzzle question, choices, correct answer index, attempts,
  provocation interval, status (pending/responded‚Äëcorrect/responded‚Äëincorrect/
  timeout), deadlines, outcomes, and any admin notices sent.
 - **ChannelConfig**: Telegram chat with mode (`moderated` | `modlog`), whether it
   is linked to other channels, and related settings (e.g., inactivity threshold
   override, provocation interval override).
 - **ModLogChannel**: The configured channel that receives notifications about
   responses, timeouts, and audit summaries for its linked moderated channels.
 - **ChannelLinkToken**: Ephemeral code used for forward‚Äëbased linking between
   a moderated channel and a modlog channel; includes code, source chat ID,
   expiry, issuer, and status (unused/used/expired).
- **Announcement**: Title, link, schedule, target channels, message template.
- **MessageArchive**: Message ID, author (username/user ID), channel (name/ID),
  content digest, timestamps (sent/edited), message type, reply_to ID, and any
  readily available Telegram metadata needed for moderation analytics.
- **ModerationAction**: Type (challenge/notify/announce), reason, actor,
  references, timestamps.

## Deployment & Config

 - Containerized deployment: Runs as a Docker container.
 - Data directory: `$DATA_DIR` defaults to `/data`; mount a volume for
  persistence. Store YAML configs under `$DATA_DIR/config/` (e.g.,
  `channels.yaml`, `timing.yaml`).
 - Database: PostgreSQL is the system of record for persistence. Connect via
  `DATABASE_URL` environment variable; connection details must be provided at
  startup.
 - Secrets: Provide the Telegram bot token via `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`; support
  standard container secret mechanisms.
- Health & resilience: On startup, validate configuration and DB connectivity;
  on restarts, reload YAML config and resume any in‚Äëflight challenge sessions
  and schedules from durable state.
- Timezone: Use UTC internally; allow display in a configured timezone if set
  (e.g., `TZ` env var), for timestamps in reports/messages.
- Logging: Emit operational logs to stdout/stderr suitable for `docker logs` and
  centralized collection.
